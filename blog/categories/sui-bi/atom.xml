    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>快要年末了，又好久没有写博客了。。。今朝随便写点生活片段的分享。因为事情太琐碎，讲给谁听估计都不会觉得咋样，就分享给网络吧。</p>

<!--more-->


<h1>先入感</h1>

<p>蛮久之前就想分享<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/07/03/upshot/a-quick-puzzle-to-test-your-problem-solving.html">这个</a>。按标题来说是一个测试你解决问题的一个小<code>Puzzle</code>。很有趣，建议测一测。然后事情是这样的，有一天正好需要烫一烫西装。妈妈帮我讲解一下，一个买了据说十多年，感觉当时应该还挺贵的<code>Philips</code>的熨斗。见下图。</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Kuo4GZI.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>熨斗上方有个按钮，据妈妈说是让熨斗喷雾，并发烫的按钮。她并解释说十多年来都是这么按上面的按钮烫的。（此处为flag。。。）我看了一下这个熨斗，感觉妈妈把熨斗从竖直位置放到水平位置之后，没按按钮之前，熨斗就已经自动出蒸汽并发烫了。我就尝试直接不按按钮，果然只要熨斗水平就会自动发烫。然而妈妈却因为自己的<code>preconception</code>，十年里一直以为要按按钮才会发烫。。。印证了前面那个<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/07/03/upshot/a-quick-puzzle-to-test-your-problem-solving.html">链接</a>中的<code>puzzle</code>所反映的问题。即，即使打破<code>preconception</code>的代价几乎为零，很多人也不愿意去尝试。很不幸，有时候也包括我自己。。。</p>

<h1>音乐感</h1>

<p>一天跟<code>s</code>君在环球的<code>bibigo</code>里面吃饭的时候，听到在放一首很熟悉的歌。回家以后就在<code>网易云音乐</code>上面想把这首歌找出来。我想这首歌肯定是在哪儿听过的，我使劲想了一下那个旋律，感觉好像是微软<code>SurfaceBook</code>发布用的BGM。就<code>百度</code>了一下，找到视频后发现好像完全不是这首。。。后来继续使劲想了一下那个旋律，终于想起来是在之前<code>B站</code>上看到的<code>M&amp;S food</code>的广告BGM。一<code>百度</code>果然是。好开心，那天晚上一直在重复播放这首歌。很好听，链接在<a href="http://music.163.com/#/song?id=28095742">这里</a>。还有纯音乐版，也很好听，链接在<a href="http://music.163.com/#/song?id=34218195">这里</a>。</p>

<h1>读书感</h1>

<p>郁君写的散文，挺感触，看到最后已经是两眼泪汪汪。摘一段，作为我<code>neo士大夫</code>主义的信条，分享一哈。郁君读书多，动不动就用了好多梗，我只知道伍子胥，其他都没有怎么听说过。不禁让我想，要是郁君生在这个时代，会不会还读这么多书呢？</p>

<blockquote><p>一</p>

<p>“比在家庭的怀抱里觉得更好的地方，是什么地方？”象这样的地方，当然是没有的，法国的这一句古歌，实在是把人情世态道尽了。</p>

<p>当微雨潇潇之夜，你若身眠古驿，看看萧条的四壁，看看一点欲尽的寒灯，倘不想起家庭的人，这人便是没有心肠者，任它草堆也好，破窑也好，你儿时放摇篮的地方，便是你死后最好的葬身之所呀！我们在客中卧病的时候，每每要想及家乡，就是这事的明证。</p>

<p>我空拳只手的奔回家去。到了杭州，又把路费用尽，在赤日的底下，在车行的道上，我就不得不步行出城。缓步当车，说起来倒是好听，但是在二十世纪的堕落的文明里沈浸过的我，既贫贱而又多骄，最喜欢张张虚势，更何况平时是以享乐为主义的我，又那里能够好好的安贫守分，和乡下人一样的蹀躞泥中呢！</p>

<p>这一天阴历的六月初三，天气倒好得很。但是炎炎的赤日，只能助长有钱有势的人的纳凉佳兴，与我这行路病者，却是丝毫无益的！我慢慢的出了风山门，立在城河桥上，一边用了我那半旧的夏布长衫襟袖，揩拭汗水，一边回头来看看杭州的城市，与杭州城上盖着的青天和城墙界上的一排山岭，真有万千的感慨，横亘在胸中。预言者自古不为其故乡所容，我今朝却只能对了故里的丘山，来求最后的荫庇，五柳先生的心事，痛可知了。</p>

<p>啊啊！亲爱的诸君，请你们不要误会，我并非是以预言者自命的人，不过说我流离颠沛，却是与预言者的境遇相同，社会错把我作了天才待遇罢了。即使罗秀才能行破石飞鸡的奇迹，然而他的品格，岂不和飘泊在欧洲大陆，猖狂乞食的其泊西（GIPSY）一样么？</p>

<p>我勉强走到了江干，腹中饥饿得很了。回故乡去的早班轮船，当然已经开出，等下午的快船出发，还有三个钟头。我在杂乱窄狭的南星桥市上飘流了一会，在靠江的一条冷清的夹道里找出了一家坍败的饭馆来。</p>

<p>饭店的房屋的骨格，同我的胸腔一样，肋骨已经一条一条的数得出来了。幸亏还有左侧的一根木椽，从邻家墙上，横着支住在那里，否则怕去秋的潮汛，早好把它拉入了江心，作伍子胥的烧饭柴火去了。店里的几张板凳桌子，都积满了灰尘油腻，好象是前世纪的遗物。账柜上坐着一个四十内外的女人，在那里做鞋子。灰色的店里，并没有什么生动的气象，只有在门口柱上贴着翅一张“安寓客商”的尘蒙的红纸，还有些微现世的感觉。我因为脚下的钱已快完，不能更向热闹的街心去寻辉煌的菜馆，所以就慢慢的踱了进去。</p>

<p>啊啊，物以类聚！你这短翼差池的饭馆，你若是二足的走兽，那我正好和你分庭抗礼结为兄弟哩。</p>

<p>二</p>

<p>假使天公下一阵微雨，把钱塘江两岸的风景，罩得烟雨模糊，把江边的泥路，浸得污浊难行，那么这时候江干的旅客，必要减去一半，那么我乘船归去，至少可以少遇见几个晓得我的身世的同乡；即使旅客不因之而减少，只教天上有暗淡的愁云蒙着，阶前屋外有几点雨滴的声音，那么围绕在我周围的空气和自然的景物，总要比现在更带有些阴惨的色彩，总要比现在和我的心境更加相符。若希望再奢一点，我此刻更想有一具黑漆棺木在我的旁边。最好是秋风凉冷的九十月之交，时落的林中，阴森的江上，不断地筛着渺蒙的秋雨。我在凋残的芦苇里，雇了一叶扁舟，当日暮的时候，在送灵柩归去。小船除舟子而外，不要有第二个人。棺里卧着的，若不是和我寝处追随的一个年少妇人，至少也须是一个我的至亲骨肉。我在灰暗微明的黄昏江上，雨声淅沥的芦苇丛中，赤了足，张了油纸雨伞，提了一张灯笼，摸上船头上去焚化纸帛。</p>

<p>我坐在靠江的一张被桌子上，等那柜上的妇人下来替我炒蛋炒饭的时候，看看西兴对岸的青山绿树，看看江上的浩荡波光，又看看在江边沙渚的晴天赤日下来往的帆樯肩舆和舟子牛车。心里忽起了一种怨恨天帝的心思。我怨恨了一阵，痴想了一阵，就把我的心愿，原原本本的排演了出来。我一边在那里焚化纸帛，一边却对棺里的人说：</p>

<p>“jEANNE！我们要回去了，我们要开船了！怕有野鬼来麻烦，你就拿这一点纸帛送给他们罢！你可要饭吃？你可安稳？你可是伤心？你不要怕，我在这里，我什么地方也不去了，我只在你的边上。……”</p>

<p>我幽幽的讲到最后的一句，咽喉就塞住了。我在座上拱了两手，把头伏了下去，两面额上，只感着了一道热气。我重新把我所欲爱的女人，一个一个想了出来，见她们闭着口眼，冰冷的直卧在我的前头。我觉得隐忍不住了，竟任情的放了一声哭声。那个在炉灶上的妇人，以为我在催她的饭，她就同哄小孩子似的用了柔和的声气说：</p>

<p>“好了好了！就快好了，请再等一会儿！”</p>

<p>啊啊！我又想起来了，我又想起来了，年幼的时候，当我哭泣的时候，祖母母亲哄我的那一种声气！</p>

<p>“已故的老祖母，倚闾的老母亲！你们的不肖的儿孙，现在正落魄了在江干等回故里的船呀！”</p>

<p>我在自己制成的伤心的泪海里游泳了一会，那妇人捧了一碗汤，一碗炒饭，摆到了我的面前来。我仰起头来对她一看，她倒惊了一跳。对我呆看了一眼，她就去绞了一块手巾来递给我，叫我擦一擦面。我对了这半老妇人的殷勤，心里说不出的只在感谢。几日来因为睡眠不足，营养不良的缘故，已经是非常感觉衰弱，动着就要流泪的我，对她的这一种感谢。也变成了两行清泪，噗嗒的滴下了腮来，她看了这种情形，就问我说：</p>

<p>“客人，你可是遇见了坏人？”</p>

<p>我摇了摇头，勉强的对她笑了一笑，什么话也不能回答。她呆呆的立了一回，看我不能讲话，也就留了一句：“饭不够吃，再好炒的。”安慰我的话，走向她的柜上去了。</p>

<p>三</p>

<p>我吃完了饭，付了她两角银角子，把找回来的八九个铜子，也送给了她，她却摇着头说：“客人，你是赶船的么？船上要用钱的地方多得很哩，这几个铜子你收着用罢！”</p>

<p>我以为她怪我吝啬，只给她几个铜子的小账，所以又摸了两角银角子出来给她。她却睁大了眼睛对我说：</p>

<p>“尹尹！这算什么？这算什么？”</p>

<p>她硬不肯收，我才知道了她的真意，所以说：“但是无论如何，我总要给你几个小账的。”</p>

<p>她又接了一会，才收了三个铜子说：</p>

<p>“小账已经有了。”</p>

<p>啊啊，我自回中国以来，遇见的都是些卑污贪暴的野心狼子，我万万想不到在浇薄的杭州城外，有这样的一个真诚的妇人的。妇人呀妇人，你的坍败的屋椽，你的凋零的店铺，大约就是你的真诚的结果，社会对你的报酬！啊啊，我真恨我没有黄金十万，为你建造一家华丽的酒楼。</p>

<p>“再会再会！”</p>

<p>“顺风顺风！船上要小心一点。”</p>

<p>“谢谢！”</p>

<p>我受妇人的怜惜，这可算是平生的第一次。</p></blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>又好久没写博客了。。。稍微写一篇超短篇随笔。最近有时候还是逛逛<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN</a>，看到<a href="http://brokedev.tumblr.com/post/128758443470/im-begging-for-work">这篇</a>文章，然后在HN看别人的<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10196231">评论</a>。</p>

<!--more-->


<p>然后评论里面就看到了一句个人觉得很有道理的话。</p>

<blockquote><p>In order to be successful, one must project an image of success at all times.</p></blockquote>

<p>具体怎么投射出成功的形象呢？个人觉得应该包含2个方面，硬件方面和软件方面。当然也有瞬间打脸的例子。比如像<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-is-worth-20-billion--and-he-drives-this-30000-hatchback-2014-1">扎克伯格</a>那样有钱，却还开着一部小破车，穿着T恤衫牛仔裤。不过毕竟人家已经是这么成功的一个公众人物了，就算自己不“映射成功的形象”，也有好事者帮他“映射成功的形象”。要更加“成功”，能体现出“成功”的装备就要更上一层楼，像车子，衣服，手表。软件方面的话，大概是谈吐，各种工作经验的包装，跟别人“盖”以前自己成功的点点滴滴之类？</p>

<p>以上。有点找不出好的语言。还是像以前学生时代写作文那样，憋不出字数的博主。。。</p>

<h1>外传</h1>

<p>上周六？还是上上周六？跟好友<code>s</code>去看了新上映的<code>碟中谍5</code>。片中开头和结尾都有这么一个梗。</p>

<blockquote><p>We can neither confirm nor deny that this is our first tweet. <br/>
&ndash; CIA</p></blockquote>

<p>出处在<a href="http://www.pri.org/stories/2015-09-07/ship-built-cias-most-audacious-cold-war-mission-now-headed-scrapyard">这里</a>。正好是看电影前几天刚读到的一篇文章。回头想了想这个电影院中是不是只有我看到了这个梗？说不出的感觉。。。</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>又好久没有更新博客了。最近朋友<code>S</code>在微信群里问<code>DDos</code>是啥。一半比较好奇<code>S</code>为啥突然询问<code>DDos</code>，一半巩固一下相关互联网常识。我谷歌了<code>DDos</code>，看到谷歌新闻卡片中，<code>Github</code>遭受<code>DDos</code>攻击的新闻。我想，哦哦哦哦，原来<code>S</code>同志是看到了这个新闻了。<a href="http://www.netresec.com/?month=2015-03&amp;page=blog&amp;post=china%27s-man-on-the-side-attack-on-github">这里</a>有该事件的一些<code>技术</code>分析？</p>

<!--more-->


<h1>题外话</h1>

<p>根据我阅读<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN</a>很多评论的经验来看，大多数意见相左的评论，讨论到最后还是互相不认可对方的观点的。原因无外乎下面这句老话。。。</p>

<blockquote><p>We believe what we want to believe. It is all we ever do.<br/>
&ndash; flemeth 《<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Age:_Origins">Dragon Age</a>》</p></blockquote>

<h1>阅读</h1>

<p>好了，回到原来的新闻事件。出于对该次事件一部分舆论反应的好奇，我在<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN</a>上搜到相关新闻的<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9293849">帖子</a>。该帖有300多条评论。总体来说，大多数评论<code>反革命</code>情绪比较严重。比如说下面这条评论。</p>

<blockquote><p>&hellip;<br/>
China and Russia are both (quite unique) examples of countries with an unfathomable degree of control over their citizens. It can be hard to grasp occasionally, coming from a western mindset but for the vast majority within said countries, the entire reality they see and what they believe to be true is heavily distorted&mdash;in that, it is defined by the vision of the oligarchy and information is carefully controlled to produce a desired set of beliefs. North Korea is an extreme caricature of this pattern.<br/>
&hellip;<br/>
&ndash; j42</p></blockquote>

<p>不过比较让人欣慰的是，可以看到有人马上回复道。</p>

<blockquote><p>The difference between the U.S. and China/Russia is that the people in China/Russia know the media is controlled by the powers that be.
Here, our press is also &ldquo;defined by the vision of the oligarchy and information is carefully controlled to produce a desired set of beliefs.&rdquo; We just believe that it&rsquo;s free.
See: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent</a><br/>
&ndash; abalone</p></blockquote>

<p>然后？然后有人看到上面那条评论就开喷了。</p>

<blockquote><p>It is rather stupid to equate the degree of media manipulation in the West vs. China and Russia.<br/>
 &ndash; obstinate</p></blockquote>

<p>于是，有位有识之士对上面那条评论进行了回复。</p>

<blockquote><p>You are right. The degree and sophistication of media manipulation is profoundly greater in the west. While the Chinese block a lot of media, the manipulation is minimal. Most Chinese are very cynical and know exactly what is going on. The west, or at least the US, traps people in a matrix of sorts where they don&rsquo;t even see the manipulation. The narrative is exquisitely framed and guided to leave people with a sense of moral superiority and basic faith in the system despite perceived flaws, as is ironically exhibited by your comment.
edit: some good resources on the history and nature of western media manipulation are the BBC documentary &ldquo;The Century of Self&rdquo; and Noam Chomsky&rsquo;s book &ldquo;Manufacturing Consent&rdquo;.<br/>
&ndash; colordrops</p></blockquote>

<p>继续往下拉，看到一条有趣的评论，还去<code>Github</code>挖了一下一个很久之前的<a href="https://github.com/greatfire/wiki/issues/1">issue</a>。</p>

<blockquote><p>Most people might not know what kind of organization GreatFire really is because too much context is missing. I only discovered recently it&rsquo;s not so simple. There have been a lot of talks about the behavior of GreatFire for quite for a while but most of the talks are in Chinese. There are some in English though, to give everybody a glimpse here is an example: <a href="https://github.com/greatfire/wiki/issues/1">https://github.com/greatfire/wiki/issues/1</a>
I have an impression is GreatFire tried to weaponize all the users of github. They succeeded.
I don&rsquo;t like the GFW either. But I think I&rsquo;m very likely to be downvoted because the context of this incident is quite complicated. It&rsquo;s not easy to tell the truth especially when it&rsquo;s against most people&rsquo;s belief.<br/>
&ndash; jjcc</p></blockquote>

<h1>感想</h1>

<p>由此，我忽然想到另外一个中策。就是在<code>Github</code>上建立小号，并且上传维鸡jie密或者shi诺d的文件。这样<code>Github</code>也有台阶下，不用被套上限制自由的骂名。<code>Github</code>可借机更新<code>ToU</code>，关闭一些政z敏感账号。</p>

<h1>附录</h1>

<p>在读帖子的时候，还看到有趣的2个人的评论。先是一个叫<code>gbog</code>的人写到。</p>

<blockquote><p>You obviously haven&rsquo;t been there. I think Chinese gov have the same level of control over its citizens as France: very erratic, sometime works well, some people try to play with fire, but overall the Chinese are all but lobotomized robots in the hands of a few puppet masters. There&rsquo;s over 500 strikes a year in China, not counting all the ones not big enough to be counted. I have seen streets of pedestrians walking against policemen, who were sweating of fear. Right now the prez is quite appreciated and trusted by the people, so he probably has some level of control, but this is earned by its fight against corruption, and not by some matrix-like brainwashing system.</p></blockquote>

<p>然后一个叫<code>westiseast</code>的人回复道。</p>

<blockquote><p>I have been there ;)
You&rsquo;re misinterpreting the nature of control. Yes, there are protests, mostly because the government lets them happen. It helps people let off steam, it gives the government an indication of how people feel, and quite often there are conflicting interests which the Party can rise above (remember, government and the Party are not the same thing). So, often it&rsquo;s a bunch of workers protesting against a company, or a corrupt local official in one department &ndash; the Party can let that happen, and choose sides later when they&rsquo;ve decided which way the wind is blowing. Policemen are shitting themselves because the Party mostly sides with the security apparatus but today they might let the protest get a bit wild if they want to allow the protesters a bit of leeway, and then those untrained, poorly equipped policemen will be screwed.
When stuff he Party doesn&rsquo;t like happens, they shut it down using methods you (on the whole) cannot do in France, the UK, and the U.S. Try introducing political censorship of material critical to Hollande. Try censoring books and courses in university. Try locking up journalists and writers (on tax evasion charges of course) when they say stuff you disagree with. Try rolling out the tanks when a protest gets out of hand. Etc.
So don&rsquo;t be fooled by the seemingly light hand of the gov &ndash; they&rsquo;ve intentionally backed off from the Cultural Recolution level of control because they know that most people don&rsquo;t give a damn, and if left alone they will do nothing. How about an experiment &ndash; I&rsquo;ll hold up an anti government sign in front of the French parliament, and you do the same in Tiananmen Square and we&rsquo;ll see how much control the Chinese gov has ;)</p></blockquote>

<p><code>gbog</code>继续回复道。</p>

<blockquote><p>You&rsquo;re misinterpreting the nature of control.
I don&rsquo;t think so. I am just taking the other angle, from the people&rsquo;s perspective, and want to debunk the cliche that Chinese people are easy to control. They&rsquo;ve had much more revolutions than any other country in their long history. They&rsquo;re all but easy to control. In French we say &ldquo;like boiling milk&rdquo;, which means they can easily and suddenly get out of control and wash out anything on their way. Just blocking a few topics on social network is certainly not enough. As for things that are allowed or forbidden, it seems more cultural than anything else: In China direct verbal confrontation is very rare, while it is very common in the West, and this holds in families, in companies and also at the country&rsquo;s level. Not very surprisingly, in France insulting the head of state is not forbidden, and even something like a national entertainment. However, in France we have laws telling people if they are allowed to work on Sundays, which seems extremely weird and borderline &ldquo;totalitarian&rdquo; to the Chinese, which believe people should be allowed to work whenever they need to or want to.
Also, when talking about China, it needs to be reminded that in fact the core Western values (i.e. Enlightment values) and the core Chinese values (i.e. Confucean values) are very similar, and quite compatible. (See how fast Chinese immigrants adapt to and adopt Western values.) For instance, secularism and religious tolerance, equality of rights and before the law, meritocracy, etc.
I think the world is going very badly these days, and a big chunk of it is in the hands of people whose values are really opposed to the core of modern humanist values, and this chunk is not China. We&rsquo;d better team up and fight (with ideas, not with guns) what really threatens humanity as a whole. Just my thoughts.</p></blockquote>

<p>这个时候有趣的事情发生了，这个<code>westiseast</code>回复道。</p>

<blockquote><p>Hey, I didn&rsquo;t see it was you! Still at Douban?
I know what you mean in terms of &ldquo;boiling milk&rdquo; &ndash; in that respect I agree. I keep thinking these days of that old saying of China as a sleeping elephant; instead I think the people are the sleeping elephant. I think the government&rsquo;s strategy relies a lot on ignorance and apathy, but if even half of these stories we read as standard on NYTimes etc made it into the public consciousness, there would be huge issues.
About the laws &ndash; I guess it&rsquo;s not the actual content of the laws or relatively different values that illustrates control. Eg in your example about working on Sunday&rsquo;s &ndash; if you decided to fight one of those laws, you could do it openly and publicly and in principle it would be a fair fight. You might even embarrass the government or a political leader, but here there&rsquo;s so little chance of that &ndash; that&rsquo;s the different nature of the Communist Party control. The government/party has taken away avenues to legitimately discuss/debate/fight, so the options are either total apathy or explosive revolution. That&rsquo;s scary!</p></blockquote>

<p>这位<code>gbog</code>先生原来在豆瓣上班。。。。。。这是他的<a href="https://github.com/guibog">github</a>和<a href="https://twitter.com/guibog">twitter</a>。</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>好久没写博客。最近上海新闻综合频道看到关于圣诞节某教堂人满为患，为预防消防隐患，巡查沐恩堂的新闻。镜头里面很多人坐在教堂里面，外面好像还有人排队。联想到好像周围也有些人入了教。。。凑巧看到某tube上的一个视频，感觉不错。做个笔记。</p>

<h1>视频</h1>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://Fatman13.github.io//www.youtube.com/embed/sXOdn6vLCuU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>视频无法显示？搜一下<code>Don't hug me I am scared 3</code>，注意是3，应该有人搬运。</p>

<h1>摘录</h1>

<p>引用该视频下，一位用户的评论。（个人感觉写得挺好）</p>

<blockquote><p>Let&rsquo;s see if I can offer an analysis of my own.</p>

<p>&mdash;&ndash; Overall &mdash;&ndash;</p>

<p>It is obvious to anyone who&rsquo;s watched the full thing that this video is about the corrupting influence of religious values and the idea of &lsquo;absolute truth&rsquo; to society, especially children or the weak-minded. Now to the more specific stuff:</p>

<p>&mdash;&ndash; Specific moments and potential meaning &mdash;&ndash;</p>

<p>0:30 This moment shows the bird killing the butterfly (or &lsquo;pesky bee&rsquo;, as he puts it), which upsets the yellow one. This shows that sometimes, people do things that will upset or scare others, because, well, people differ in moral values. However, the yellow one feels it is wrong to the point where he is disillusioned, making him easy prey for the religious.</p>

<p>0:44 Here we see a priest or preacher-like figure (the butterfly/pesky bee/little baby pigeon) using a common religious tactic: asserting that the entire world is evil to make their own order seem like the good guys. They set the world up to be a horrible place full of hatred, and present their religion as a refuge from that. Such religious strategies are most effective on those easily swayed by smooth talk and misanthropes/the disillusioned and cynical. In this case, the yellow one is a combination of the naive and the disillusioned.</p>

<p>0:54 Here the priest goes on to say his religion has all the answers. He does not need to present facts, as a naive person will take his assertions at face value. Opening with the rhetorical question of &lsquo;have you ever wondered why we&rsquo;re here?&rsquo; he goes ahead and answers his own question, forcing his own ideas of life and purpose onto the naive recipient of his &lsquo;gospel&rsquo;.</p>

<p>1:17 Here we have the priest offering comfort (in the form of offering to hold his hand), however, when the yellow one reaches out to hold said hand, the priest ignores his request for comfort. This shows the priests true feelings for his flock&rsquo;s feelings- apathy, merely people to lead along with promises of comfort.</p>

<p>1:47 Here the priest does another common tactic to ensure loyal followers- implicitly lowering your self-worth by stating (without proof) the world&rsquo;s opinions of you, claiming everyone hates you. It can also be seen as a priest breaking self-esteem by claiming that you, as a mere human, are nothing compared to God and that God should be (as in the Christian faith) torturing you as well as everyone else forever, and only lets some of us not out of his &lsquo;love&rsquo; and &lsquo;kindness.</p>

<p>2:00 Here, the priest offsets real-life needs (like hunger in this case) for imaginary, constructed &lsquo;needs&rsquo;, like sin and &lsquo;spiritual illness&rsquo; of similar sorts. He establishes this by calling him lonely, in this case, and later as is shown, the naive believer-to-be genuinely comes to believe that they are &lsquo;spiritually ill&rsquo;, cementing their faith through low self-esteem yet again.</p>

<p>2:05 Here, the proselyte begins to ask questions of his own, however, the priest brushes off the questions due to them not being his own rhetorical ones that will lead into more convincing spiel. Hence he just says that all his questions will be answered soon.</p>

<p>2:08 His friends are naturally the congregation. Congregations are a necessary structure of religion, as it makes the religion more of a community thing, and ensures conformity to the religion, as if one decides to leave, they will be invariably shunned by the community.</p>

<p>2:13 Here is a mostly comical interlude, but it does show that when people join a religion that could have deleterious effects, a lot of people, assuming religion is harmless, decide not to lift a finger to stop people falling into insane piety.</p>

<p>2:32 The insistence that all the congregation loves the proselyte by the priest is another part of his &lsquo;refuge&rsquo; spiel. If they all appear to be friendly from the offset, it allows the proselyte to settle in and become dependent on the community later on, despite its rotten core.</p>

<p>2:42 This &lsquo;furry boy&rsquo; is a representative of the more perverse members of religious organisations, the ones that exploit the overly trusting nature of religious congregations for sexual purposes.</p>

<p>2:44 Once again, mostly a comedic aside, but it highlights the sheer apathy people have regarding the deleterious effects of religion on society.</p>

<p>3:02 The rabbit speaks in a simpleton&rsquo;s voice and is overly physically friendly. He is likely representative of the genuinely kind, good-hearted (yet socially awkward due to religious conditioning) and overall true believers. Unlike the perverse member, who exploits, this one genuinely hangs on to everything the priest says, and as his later words following the Story of Michael show, he is willing to come up with positive interpretations of any and every &lsquo;religious text&rsquo; of his religion.</p>

<p>3:10 Here the yellow one begins to get carried away and interprets the faith his own way. This is where the priest steps in and corrects him to ensure conformity, as all priests by trade kinda have to do.</p>

<p>3:12 The idea of &lsquo;your special one&rsquo; is not criticised as a criticism of religion, however it is a criticism of imposing the ideas of absolute truth onto things. The idea of there being a special one for all is dubious to say the least, others would say there are many compatible people for many others, etc, etc, however, the priest states it as an absolute truth, and the proselyte, being simple-minded, believes him.</p>

<p>3:20 Here we have the proselyte bemoaning his &lsquo;spiritual sickness&rsquo; that he only began realising once the priest fabricated it. This is to show the influence priests have over the weak-willed. The priest then has the gall to say that yes, he is sick, and that he&rsquo;s confused and stupid, and that he should just let him, the priest, do the thinking for him</p>

<p>3:28 The Story of Michael is analagous to, say, Biblical stories that are meant to illustrate a point, like, say, the love of God, but never actually do, just as the Story of Michael never gets onto Michael finding his special one or being loved. A perfect example would be the Book of Job, wherein God allows an innocent, God-fearing man become the plaything of Satan for, as he puts it, no reason. Satan proceeds to kill his children, servants, and gives Job sores. Job keeps loyal to God for an admirable time before finally God ends the bet and Job rightfully asks why, wondering if he&rsquo;s just. God proceeds to say he&rsquo;s so powerful that he&rsquo;s above good and evil, and Job sarcastically notes he has nothing to say to that. However, both priests and enthusiastic believers (like the aforementioned rabbit) cite the book of Job as a sign of Job&rsquo;s loyalty to God (though he in fact became bitter) and God&rsquo;s love for Job (because apparently replacing Job&rsquo;s children and servants apparently undoes the loss of his first beloved children and all the deaths of the tangentially related servants).</p>

<p>3:56 Here the priest once again states the proselytes desires for him, giving him needs where he didn&rsquo;t have any before.</p>

<p>4:01 The idea of being patient and hoping that the promises of the faith be delivered is the crux of holding believers. Paying believers in promises is how priests keep controlling people without repercussions. Heaven will eventually come. Armageddon will eventually come, if you happen to be the death cult-level sects like Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses, Jihad, the coming of Kalki, etc etc. All of these are unfulfilled promises religions make to either hold their followers in wait for their reward, or keeps them paralysed in fear of genocide/retribution.</p>

<p>4:05 Here&rsquo;s the more Judeo-Christian specific areas- &lsquo;he&rsquo;s made for her and she&rsquo;s made for him&rsquo; is the very basis of homophobic attitudes enforced by religion. Saying &lsquo;that&rsquo;s the way it&rsquo;s always been&rsquo;, as well as protecting the sanctity of marriage and no divorce being allowed are all alluded to in this segment, and are all criticising the assertions by the religious that straight marriage is the only acceptable form of romantic love.</p>

<p>4:21 Here is where the final piece of the religious puzzle comes in. So far, the ideas of asserting absolute truths, breaking self esteem to ensure compliance and dependency, and exploiting the naive and disillusioned could all be said of a secular cult of some sort too. However, religion is special in that it also (quite randomly) shoehorns in a supernatural deity, often one which all good sprouts from, but yet can also be angry. Gravel feeding is representative of blood sacrifice, mass, ramadan, any other sort of ritualistic behaviour which the religious demand in order to appease their God.</p>

<p>4:39 Here is a criticism of another tactic used by priests, related to the poisoning of the prospective proselyte&rsquo;s worldview- in addition to convincing the person that the world cannot be trusted and is evil (as opposed to their cult, which can be, according to them), they also tell them to forget the world, essentially, rejecting true reality for the cult&rsquo;s twisted version. Here they refer to it as &lsquo;changing your name&rsquo; (likely a reference to biblical name changes representing covenants with God, like Abram to Abraham and Jacob to Israel) and &lsquo;cleaning your brain&rsquo; (a reference to rejecting reality that conflicts with your faith).</p>

<p>4:52 Here the final initiation concludes, and the promise of never being alone acts as a two-edged sword- yes, in a religious community, you&rsquo;ll never be alone, but you can never escape it either, never be free from its judging eyes.</p>

<p>5:08 Here, in a surprising bit of heartwarming material, the duck shows that (in a way) the world the religious describe as twisted and evil actually DOES care about a person if you let it. Shame it ends on a jump scare.</p>

<p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s my take on this. I&rsquo;d like to see what people think!﻿</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The role played by time at the beginning of the universe is, I believe, the final key to removing the need for a Grand Designer, and revealing how the universe created itself. … Time itself must come to a stop. You can’t get to a time before the big bang, because there was no time before the big bang. We have finally found something that does not have a cause because there was no time for a cause to exist in. For me this means there is no possibility of a creator because there is no time for a creator to have existed. Since time itself began at the moment of the Big Bang, it was an event that could not have been caused or created by anyone or anything. … So when people ask me if a god created the universe, I tell them the question itself makes no sense. Time didn’t exist before the Big Bang, so there is no time for God to make the universe in. It’s like asking for directions to the edge of the Earth. The Earth is a sphere. It does not have an edge, so looking for it is a futile exercise.<br/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>公告，顾妈妈网一期试运行版上线啦。大家也快来<a href="gumama13.com">访问</a>吧。非常可惜<code>gumama.com</code>这个域名被人捷足先登了。好像是一个叫<code>谷妈妈</code>的婚庆网站。在下只能屈就于<code>gumama13.com</code>这个域名了。现在随便写下点什么。</p>

<h1>流量统计</h1>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/u4MlWXT.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>使用<a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a>统计的第一天的流量。不过由于<code>Rails 4</code>自带的<code>turbo link</code>功能，不一定每次翻页都统计进去了。尝试了<code>SO</code>上<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18632644/google-analytics-with-rails-4">这个</a>答案。但是好像没有起到作用。</p>

<h1>部署</h1>

<p>这次部署使用了<a href="http://www.aliyun.com/?utm_medium=text&amp;utm_source=bdbrand&amp;utm_campaign=bdbrand">阿里云</a>。用下来真的挺好。而且阿里在使用百度推广的时候确实也挺精明。在大搜中搜索例如<code>Azure</code>，<code>ucloud</code>等等其他云服务供应商的时候，阿里故意买这些敏感词汇，然后打出自己的广告。</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/S3PtAJL.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>搜索"Azure"。</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/a4456Kx.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>搜索"uCloud"</p>

<p>而且<code>阿里云</code>在同类型云服务提供商中间，确实有价格优势，一个月55元。1核CPU，512MB内存，20G硬盘，1MBps网络流量，<code>Ubuntu 12.04</code>，对一个初出茅庐的小网站，是绰绰有余了。阿里杭州机房的响应速度也是良好。在用<code>passenger</code>部署我的<code>Rails 4</code>应用的时候，<code>passenger</code>提示我最好有1G内存，并且给了增加<code>swap</code>内存的指令。阿里云机器默认没有<code>swap</code>内存，不过使用root之后倒也改成功了。不知道是不是阿里云的初衷。</p>

<h1>题外话</h1>

<p>推荐一个4月神番，<a href="http://comic.letv.com/zt/pingpongbili/index.shtml#p1">乒乓</a>。就第一集来看，在下非常喜欢这部片子。鄙人总结了一些该番的看点。虽然都是一些商业片惯用的手法，但是运用的恰到好处。</p>

<h4>&mdash;&ndash;> 剧透分割线 &lt;&mdash;&ndash;</h4>

<ul>
<li>猪脚不苟言笑，但是有个外号叫"smile"</li>
<li>片子开头和当中2段<code>教练</code>和<code>山田队长</code>的对话，埋下了很多伏笔。不经意间带过了很多事情。特别是开头那段对话，后面<code>阿扁</code>被<code>China</code>打败时，让人不禁有“哇~”的感觉。</li>
<li>分镜和<code>BGM</code>也是一流。（从分镜就能感觉到制作满满的诚意）</li>
<li>人物各种幽默的对话，在CV的演绎下，感觉特别好。这个<code>China</code>的教练的CV很好，<code>China</code>的CV一般。</li>
<li><code>12:58</code>和<code>13:17</code>日本教练的细节表情。<code>16:32</code>天空中有鸟飞过。</li>
<li><code>China</code>和<code>阿扁</code>的对局很燃！</li>
<li>对局后<code>China</code>的自我评价，让人对角色的好感度上升很多。</li>
</ul>
