Somehow whenever I boot up my `Ubuntu`, `Bluetooth` would be set to **ON**. `Ubuntu` didn't seem to remember whether `Bluetooth` was set to **ON** or **OFF** from last session. Personally I don't use any `Bluetooth` input devices. I'd like to have it **OFF** so that it doesn't waste battery.

*Be warned: This tutorial may only applies to System 76 Gazelle pro running Ubuntu 13.04 64-bit. There is also a risk that your Ubuntu splash screen will behave a little differently after applying the change.*

There is a good [post](http://catlingmindswipe.blogspot.com/2012/05/how-to-disable-bluetooth-on-startup.html) for fixing the problem. But in case of `System 76 Gazelle pro` running `Ubuntu 13.04 64-bit`, you only need to apply the following steps. (I guess it is due to more customized driver?)

**1**. It is recommended that you back up your config file first.
```
$ sudo cp /etc/bluetooth/main.conf /etc/bluetooth/main.conf.bak
```

**2**. Open up the config file in a text editor
```
$ sudo gedit /etc/bluetooth/main.conf
```

**3**. Change `InitiallyPowered = true` to `InitiallyPowered = false`.

And you are done! Reboot your machine and see the result yourself. 

# Update 

If you set `Ubuntu` to login automatically like I did. Then you might be prompt for login keyring after rebooting. To get rid of the keyring dialog you need to do the [following](http://askubuntu.com/questions/867/how-can-i-stop-being-prompted-to-unlock-the-default-keyring-on-boot).

**1**. Launch `Passwords and Keys` through Utility Launcher.

**2**. Go to `View`->`By keyring`. You should see the following window.

**3**. Right click `Login`, choose `Change Password`. Type in your old password, then leave new password as empty.

That's it. Enjoy!
